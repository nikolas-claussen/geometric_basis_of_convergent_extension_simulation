# geometric_basis_of_convergent_extension_simulation
Code for the simulations shown in the paper "The geometric basis of epithelial convergent extension" by F. Brauns, N.H. Claussen, E.F. Wieschaus, and B.I. Shraiman.

The code is provided as an interactive jupyter notebook that reproduces all simulations plots shown in the paper, in particular, main text Fig. 4. Required libraries are listed in the jupyter notebook.
